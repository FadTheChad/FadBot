# About The Project
FadBot is a multipurpose and open-source discord bot currently being developed using javascript. Currently at the time of `v0.x.x` it doesn't really do much, but i will try my best to frequently add more features.

Here are some things that you can expect from the bot:

* None of the main features of the bot will be put behind a paywall.
* Might have some fun minigames that you could play with your friends!
* Will implement some of the new features of the Discord API such as Context and Dropdown Menus, Buttons, Ephemeral Messages (and hopefully slash commands and threads).

## Built With
* [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)

## Devs
* Fad The Chad

## Version
**Current Version:** v0.5.0

See `CHANGELOG.md` for all changes

# Get Started

## Requirements
Node `v16.6+` is required. You can install it at their [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repo

1. Install the NPM Packages
    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Make a `config.json` file in the root of the directory and add:
    ```json
    "token": "Your Token Here",
    "prefix": "Your Prefix Here",
    "devs": ["devId1", "devId2"]
    ```
   - `token` is the Bot's Token. You can recieve it from Discord's Developer Portal.
   - `prefix` is the bot's prefix.
   - `devs` stores the ID of discord users that can run secret dev commands. You can add as many devs as you want but its recommended to keep it small.
